Please note this is not a huge change in the code. Essentially, this is provided
with two function replacements that are now deprecated -- and designed to keep
PHPMailer-FE functional.

Althought not necessary, it is advisable to include:

phpmailer-fe.php
class.phpmailer.php (or class.phpmailer-lite.php)

in the _lib/ directory and set the basic settings.

Strategies employed in this sample form:

* phpmailer-fe.php is in the _lib/ directory
* class.phpmailer.php is in the _lib/ directory
  - means phpmailer-fe.php will use class.phpmailer.php to handle the sending of data
* OR class.phpmailer-lite.php is in the _lib/ directory
  - means phpmailer-fe.php will use class.phpmailer-lite.php to handle the sending of data
* the reply email templates are in the _lib/ directory
  - means that PHPMailer will use the images from its local _lib/_src/ directory
  note: if you put the reply email templates in any other directory, change
        the <img tag to an explicit URL for source
* the landing pages templates are in the _lib/ directory
  - phpmailer-fe.php will not substitute the image tags ...
  note: if you put the landing pages templates in any other directory, change
        the <img tag to an explicit URL for source

* the sample forms are fully functional

Reference documents are in the DOCS directory.

Please note, the packaging of PHPMailer-FE has changed. PHPMailer-FE is now in
the _lib directory off of the root (as are all other support files).
